# Orunmilang
**Orunmilang** is a minimal, beginner-friendly programming language inspired by the syntax and linguistic structure of Yoruba, a major African language spoken by millions in Nigeria, Benin, and the global diaspora. Designed to teach programming fundamentals through culturally relevant constructs, Orunmilang bridges the gap between technology and indigenous knowledge systems. The name **Orunmilang** derives from Yoruba words: *òrúnmìlà* (the deity of wisdom and divination in Yoruba spirituality) and *ọ̀rọ̀* (word or language), symbolizing a "language of wisdom." This reflects its mission to empower learners by making coding intuitive and culturally resonant.

Orunmilang was created as part of a master’s coursework project in Open Source Software at Nankai University, China, in 2025. It aims to democratize programming education by offering a tool that resonates with African and diasporic learners while being accessible to anyone interested in culturally inspired computing. In a world where technology often reflects Western paradigms, Orunmilang promotes diversity in tech by embedding Yoruba linguistic patterns, such as verb-object structures and tonal expressiveness, into its syntax. This makes it a powerful educational tool and a potential domain-specific language (DSL) for cultural computing, fostering inclusivity and representation in the global tech landscape.

## 🌍 Vision & Roadmap
Orunmilang aims to make programming inclusive by blending coding with Yoruba linguistic structures. It serves as an educational tool and potential domain-specific language (DSL) for cultural computing. Future goals include expanding the type system, adding data structures, and deepening cultural relevance.


### Short-term Goals:

- Add list/array support

- Implement basic file I/O

- Expand standard library

- Long-term Vision:

- Full Yoruba localization

- Visual programming interface

- Educational materials in Yoruba/English



## ✨ Features

### Core Language Features
✅ **Variable Declaration** (`pa`): Declare variables with initial values  
✅ **Variable Assignment** (`fi`): Update variable values  
✅ **Print Output** (`tẹ`): Display text, numbers, or variable values  
✅ **Arithmetic Operations**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`  
✅ **Conditionals** (`ti`/`bí kò ṣe`): If/else-if/else statements  
✅ **Loops** (`nigba`): While loops  
✅ **Functions** (`iṣẹ`/`pe`/`pada`): Define and call reusable functions  
✅ **Comments**: Single-line documentation  

### Tooling Features
✅ **CLI Support**: Run programs with error reporting  
✅ **Type Checking**: Runtime type validation  
✅ **Yoruba Keywords**: Culturally relevant syntax  

### Cultural Elements  
- Yoruba keywords and syntax structure  
- Support for Yoruba diacritics in strings  
- Culturally relevant error messages  


### Core Programming Constructs  
- `pa` - Variable declaration (`pa oruko pẹlu "Lanlokun"`)  
- `fi` - Variable assignment (`fi oruko "Malik"`)  
- `tẹ` - Print output (`tẹ("Kaabo!")`)  
- `ti`/`bí kò ṣe` - If/else conditionals  
- `nigba` - While loops  
- `iṣẹ`/`pe` - Function definition and calls  


## 📜 Example Program

```orunmilang
// Calculate the square of a number
iṣẹ square(num) {
    pada num * num;
}

pa x pẹlu 10;
pa y pẹlu 5;
pa sum pẹlu x + y;      // 15
pa squared pẹlu pe square(x);  // 100

tẹ("Sum:");
tẹ(sum);
tẹ("Square of x:");
tẹ(squared);

ti (sum > 20) {
    tẹ("Sum is large");
} bí kò ṣe {
    tẹ("Sum is small");
}

```
## Output:

```
Sum:
15
Square of x:
100
Sum is small
```

## 🧠 Language Syntax

### 🔸 Variable Declaration

```orunmilang

pa <name> pẹlu <value>;  // Numbers, strings, or booleans
```

###  Variable Assignment

```orunmilang

fi <name> <value>;  // Update existing variable

```

### Print Statement

```orunmilang
  tẹ(<value>);
```
### Arithmetic Operations
``` orunmilang
<value1> + <value2>  // Addition
<value1> - <value2>  // Subtraction
<value1> * <value2>  // Multiplication
<value1> / <value2>  // Division
<value1> % <value2>  // Modulo

```
### Control Flow


```orunmilang
ti (age > 18) ṣe {
    tẹ("O ti tobi!");    // "You're grown!"
} bí kò ṣe {
    tẹ("O tun kekere");  // "You're still young"
}

pa i pẹlu 0;
nigba (i < 5) ṣe {
    tẹ(i);
    fi i i + 1;
}

```

#

### Functions

``` orunmilang

iṣẹ greet(oruko) {
    pada "Kaabo, " + oruko;
}

tẹ(pe greet("Lanlokun"));  // Kaabo, Lanlokun

```
### Comments

```orunmilang

// Single-line comment

```
